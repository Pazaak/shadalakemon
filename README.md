Hi there!

Well, I've been occupied with this childish project for a while this summer. It is an implementation of the famous Pok√©mon Trading Card Game (if someone at Nintendo is reading this, please, please, don't make me take this out, this has been just a programming exercise).

Why this card game, you may ask. I wanted to implement a card game for a while and I chose this one in particular because it has very easy mechanics. I've made all the implementation for the base set cards and a very simple AI that plays them.

Ultimately I decided not to put much more time into this project. Nintendo has a very strict ruling about using their IPs to create fan games and I don't want to devote time into a thing, even if it's created with my best wishes, that cannot be enjoyed by other fans. This won't stop me from improving things as a hobby, this is my child after all ;)

I'll leave here the link to the latest test version. It is plagued with bugs, so please report whatever you may find:
